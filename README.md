<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Scenario
Your company executives at VodaFone have an interest reducing Customer Churn. You have to build a model that predicts customer churn to be used in preventative measures leading to reduced churn.

### Project Structure
The project uses the CRISP-DM Framework. 
Our first part covers the Business Understanding and setting up the criteria for success.  
we head to the second phase where we look at the Datasets we have and analyse them to understand the relationship between features and answer business questions.
We build a model to predict the target variable and evaluate the model performance.
We finalise by a conclsuion of the Business Impact Assessment of the model and its performance.
