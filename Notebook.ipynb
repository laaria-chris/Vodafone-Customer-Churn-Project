    "## **Project Overview:**\n",
    "The goal of this data project is to create a machine learning model that predicts customer churn for Vodafone Group. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a service or product. In the context of Vodafone, it means customers leaving their mobile or telecom services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business Context:**\n",
    "Vodafone Group is a global telecommunications company with millions of customers worldwide. Retaining existing customers is crucial for their business success. By predicting customer churn, Vodafone can take proactive measures to retain high-risk customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is predicting churn important?**\n",
    "Churn prediction helps Vodafone identify customers who are likely to leave the service. By addressing their concerns or offering incentives, Vodafone can reduce churn rates and improve customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What data is available?**\n",
    "Vodafone has access to historical customer data, including demographics, usage patterns, billing information, additional services, and more. \n",
    "The available data has the following columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Column** | **Description** |\n",
    "|--------|--------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Gender | Whether the customer is a male or a female |\n",
    "| SeniorCitizen | Whether a customer is a senior citizen or not |\n",
    "| Partner | Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No) |\n",
    "| Dependents | Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No) |\n",
    "| Tenure | Number of months the customer has stayed with the company |\n",
    "| Phone Service | Whether the customer has a phone service or not (Yes, No) |\n",
    "| MultipleLines | Whether the customer has multiple lines or not |\n",
    "| InternetService | Customer's internet service provider (DSL, Fiber Optic, No) |\n",
    "| OnlineSecurity | Whether the customer has online security or not (Yes, No, No Internet) |\n",
    "| OnlineBackup | Whether the customer has online backup or not (Yes, No, No Internet) |\n",
    "| DeviceProtection | Whether the customer has device protection or not (Yes, No, No internet service) |\n",
    "| TechSupport | Whether the customer has tech support or not (Yes, No, No internet) |\n",
    "| StreamingTV | Whether the customer has streaming TV or not (Yes, No, No internet service) |\n",
    "| StreamingMovies | Whether the customer has streaming movies or not (Yes, No, No Internet service) |\n",
    "| Contract | The contract term of the customer (Month-to-Month, One year, Two year) |\n",
    "| PaperlessBilling | Whether the customer has paperless billing or not (Yes, No) |\n",
    "| Payment Method | The customer's payment method (Electronic check, mailed check, Bank transfer(automatic), Credit card(automatic)) |\n",
    "| MonthlyCharges | The amount charged to the customer monthly |\n",
    "| TotalCharges | The total amount charged to the customer |\n",
    "| Churn | Whether the customer churned or not (Yes or No) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Relevant features may include:**\n",
    "1. Customer demographics (age, gender, etc.)\n",
    "2. Usage metrics (Phone Service, Multiple Lines, etc.)\n",
    "3. Billing information (monthly charges, contract type etc.)\n",
    "4. Additional service interactions (Internet service, Streaming services, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are the business objectives?**\n",
    "1. Reduce customer churn by identifying high-risk customers early.\n",
    "2. Optimize marketing efforts by targeting specific customer segments.\n",
    "3. Improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How will the model be used?**\n",
    "The churn prediction model will be integrated into Vodafone’s customer management system.\n",
    "It will generate alerts for high-risk customers, allowing customer service representatives to take proactive actions (e.g., personalized offers, retention campaigns).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are the success criteria?**\n",
    "The success of the project will be evaluated based on:\n",
    "**Good:** Correctly predicting churn at least 70% of the time.\n",
    "**Best:** Accurately predicting churn at least 80% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach:**\n",
    "1. Data Collection and Exploration:\n",
    "    * Gather historical customer data from various sources.\n",
    "    * Explore the data to understand its quality, completeness, and relevance.\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering:\n",
    "    * Create relevant features from the available data.\n",
    "    * Examples: churn history, customer tenure, usage patterns, billing metrics.\n",
    "3. Model Selection:\n",
    "    * Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests).\n",
    "    * Evaluate models based on performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).\n",
    "4. Model Training and Validation:\n",
    "    * Split the data to train and test data\n",
    "    * Train the model on historical data.\n",
    "    * Validate the model’s performance using unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hypotheses:**\n",
    "`Null Hypothesis (H0)`: Customer tenure does not significantly impact churn.\\\n",
    "`Alternative Hypothesis (H1)`: Customer tenure significantly affects churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Analytical Questions:**\n",
    "1. What are the top 3 features that have strong correlation to churn?\n",
    "2. What was the financial impact of customer churn on Vodafone's revenue?\n",
    "3. What are the prevalent contract types and payment methods among customers exhibiting churn behavior?\n",
    "4. How does the distribution of tenure differ between churned and retained customers?\n",
    "5. Is there a correlation between churn and specific internet service types (e.g., fiber vs. DSL)?\n",
    "6. How do different payment methods (e.g., electronic check, credit card) correlate with churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "Predicting customer churn is essential for Vodafone’s business strategy. By leveraging machine learning, Vodafone can proactively address customer needs, reduce churn rates, and enhance overall customer satisfaction."
